# Homework

Build a RESTful CRUD API to manage a collection of books.

1. Save the books in memory. A simple array should suffice.
2. Mutate the array, when creating/updating/deleting books.
3. Return useful error objects when something goes wrong.

<SwaggerUI url="../public/swagger/3-node.json" dialog class="my-4" >
  Show API specification
</SwaggerUI>

4. Bonus: Host your Swagger UI on the server and make it accessible via a URL.<br>
   See [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express).

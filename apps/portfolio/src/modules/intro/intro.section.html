    Growing up in southern Bavaria I enjoyed skiing from an early childhood. At
    the same time I developed a fascination with computers and video games.
    However, during my teenage years I ended up bored with those and discoverd
    the satisfaction of writing code myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    I moved from southern Germany to the Baltic Sea and back again after taking
    care of my grandmother for about a decade.
  </p>

    While studying computer science it became clear that I had a passion for the
    web. The video game-esque loop of
    <i>think - build - test - repeat</i>, combined with the instant feedback
    modern web frameworks provide, scratches that itch perfectly.<br />Attacking
    a problem from every angle until I find an efficient solution, while meeting
    the challenge of time and budget constraints of the real world can be quite
    exciting - like a good run in Tetris.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am grateful for being one of the very few who truly enjoy their
    profession.

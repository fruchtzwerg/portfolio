'Sounds good but how can you help me', you ask?<br />
Simple: I will deal with all your frontend needs swiftly and expertly.

- Have a lot of backend or fullstack developers, who cringe at the idea of deep-diving into
  JavaScript and CSS? - Challenge accepted.
- Want proper frontend architecture to improve maintainability and velocity, independent of backend
  complexity? - Put me in coach.
- Users start feeling the age of your frontend tech-stack? Time to identify opportunities and
  pick the perfect technology.
- Your frontend is on fire and you need someone to extinguish those flames and clean up
  afterwards? - Ready for duty, chief.
- Planning to build a new frontend from scratch and don't know what to account for? - Been there,
  done that.

I will enrich your team with vast knowledge in all things frontend. Your backend devs and data
engineers can concentrate on their field of expertise and I do what I do best: Make it functional -
make it scale - make it fancy.

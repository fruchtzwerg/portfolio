## <IconTeam /> Teamwork

I am easy going but hard working.

Integrating into an established team is never easy but always very valuable. The most important
thing is to ask for help, when necessary. I never hide my inadequacies: When I don't understand
something I say so and when I need help I ask for it. On a personal level this shows vulnerability
and builds trust. On a professional one it helps me grow and maximizes everyone's time-efficiency.

Although I try to be diplomatic, I always give feedback without reservation and demand the same in
return. Letting issues fester - technical or personal - is no way to build complex systems and
will only impede progress.

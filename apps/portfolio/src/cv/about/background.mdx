## <IconBackground /> Background

Like a lot of nerds I started interacting with machines quite early. Got my first computer at five,
played lots of Monkey Island and helped relatives to setup their computers by the time I was eight.

In my teenage years the very same relatives kept telling me that computers had no future and I
should invest my time in more fruitful endeavors. 20 years later I'm at the top of my field - still
helping with the occasional printer or WiFi issue. The more things change the more they stay the
same I guess.

The future is going to be very interesting and I love building it.

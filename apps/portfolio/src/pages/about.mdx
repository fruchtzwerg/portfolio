## <IconBackground class="text-4xl" /> Background

Like a lot of nerds I started interacting with machines quite early. Got my first computer at five,
played lots of Monkey Island and helped relatives to setup their computers by the time I was eight.

In my teenage years the very same relatives kept telling me that computers had no future and I
should invest my time in more fruitful endeavors. 20 years later I'm at the top of my field - still
helping with the occasional printer or WiFi issue. The more things change the more they stay the
same I guess.

The future is going to be very interesting and I love building it.

## <IconPhilosophy class="text-4xl" /> Philosophy

When building apps I like to take a birds-eye view of the requirements and pick my tech-stack
based on that. I also enjoy trying out new things. That's why I have a broad spectrum of experience
with a variety of different technologies and the ability to pick up new concepts effortlessly.

I like Astro and Svelte but unfortunately they are the exception. Not everything that shines
is gold and not every new framework proves useful in the longrun.

There are a few golden gods that I keep going back to, though: Angular for large-scale, Vue for smaller things
NestJS if I need to touch the backend myself, although this is best avoided - I am **not** a fullstack
developer. I prefer being the best frontend engineer I can be, rather than a jack of all trades,
master of none.

I got the opportunity to pass on some of those hard earned lessons at University of
Applied Sciences Stralsund as a lecturer for the Web Engineering II course.

## <IconTeam class="text-4xl" /> Teamwork

I am easy going but hard working.

Integrating into an established team is never easy but always very valuable. The most important
thing is to ask for help, when necessary. I never hide my inadequacies: When I don't understand
something I say so and when I need help I ask for it. On a personal level this shows vulnerability
and builds trust. On a professional one it helps me grow and maximizes everyone's time-efficiency.

Although I try to be diplomatic, I always give feedback without reservation and demand the same in
return. Letting issues fester - technical or personal - is no way to build complex systems and
will only impede progress.

#### I work from home! Now hold on I know what you're thinking.

I've tried it all: Being in the office every day, part-time office - part-time from home and fully
remote.

The data is in and very conclusive. I work most efficiently from home because I truly, **truly** love
my chosen profession. In fact you will have trouble making me stop raking in overtime. Solving
engineering problems is so much fun I get in the flow forget to stop.

Establishing and maintaining these flow-states is critical for high performance work and the quality
of our products!<br/>
It is also impossible to do so in an office environment. Sometimes you just need that 30 minute break
to think about a problem in the shower or while walking the dog or working out.

Everything is negotiable of course but I know myself and I do not accept offers without being
100% confident, that I can deliver the best quality and highest efficiency.

## <IconBrain class="text-4xl" /> Services

'Sounds good but how can you help me', you ask?<br />
Simple: I will deal with all your frontend needs swiftly and expertly.

- Have a lot of backend developers (some might be disguised as fullstack devs <IconWink class="inline text-lg" />), who cringe at the idea
  of deep-diving into JavaScript and CSS? - I'm your man.
- Want proper frontend architecture to improve maintainability and velocity, independent of backend
  complexity? - Put me in coach.
- Users start feeling the age of your frontend tech-stack? I'll identify risks and opportunities and
  pick the perfect technology or make recommendations.
- Your frontend is on fire and you need someone to extinguish those flames and clean up
  afterwards? - I really need to get myself one of those sliding poles, they're so much fun.
- Or simply want some nice animations to make your application feel more polished, engaging and fun
  to work with? - I got you covered.

I will enrich your team with vast knowledge in all things frontend. Your backend devs and data
engineers can concentrate on their field of expertise and I do what I do best: Make it functional -
make it scale - make it fancy.

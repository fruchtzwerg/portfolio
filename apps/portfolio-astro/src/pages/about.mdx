<Portrait />

Growing up in southern Bavaria I enjoyed skiing from an early childhood. At
the same time I developed a fascination with computers and video games.
However, during my teenage years I ended up bored with those and discoverd
the satisfaction of writing code myself.

I moved from southern Germany to the Baltic Sea and back again after taking
care of my grandmother for about a decade.

While studying computer science it became clear that I had a passion for the
web. The video game-esque loop of _think - build - test - repeat_, combined with the instant feedback modern web frameworks
provide, scratches that itch perfectly.

Attacking a problem from every angle until I find an efficient solution, while meeting the challenge
of time and budget constraints of the real world can be quite exciting - like a good run in Tetris.

I am grateful for being one of the very few who truly enjoy their
profession.

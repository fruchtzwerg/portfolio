Composition API

Vue supports two APIs: **Options API** and **Composition API**.

Use Composition API with `<script setup>` for single file components.

- Reactive **mutable data** via `ref()` and `reactive()`
- Reactive **computed properties** via `computed()`
- **Watchers** via `watch()`
- **Lifecycle hooks** via `onMounted()`, `onUnmounted()`, etc.

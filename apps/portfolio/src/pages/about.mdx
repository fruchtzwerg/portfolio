## <IconBrain /> Services

'Sounds good but how can you help me', you ask?<br />
Simple: I will deal with all your frontend needs swiftly and expertly.

- Have a lot of backend developers (some might be disguised as fullstack devs <IconWink class="inline text-lg" />), who cringe at the idea
  of deep-diving into JavaScript and CSS? - I'm your man.
- Want proper frontend architecture to improve maintainability and velocity, independent of backend
  complexity? - Put me in coach.
- Users start feeling the age of your frontend tech-stack? I'll identify risks and opportunities and
  pick the perfect technology or make recommendations.
- Your frontend is on fire and you need someone to extinguish those flames and clean up
  afterwards? - I really need to get myself one of those sliding poles, they're so much fun.
- Or simply want some nice animations to make your application feel more polished, engaging and fun
  to work with? - I got you covered.

I will enrich your team with vast knowledge in all things frontend. Your backend devs and data
engineers can concentrate on their field of expertise and I do what I do best: Make it functional -
make it scale - make it fancy.

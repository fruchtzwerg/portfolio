## <IconPhilosophy /> Philosophy

When building apps I like to take a birds-eye view of the requirements and pick my tech-stack
based on that. I also enjoy trying out new things. That's why I have a broad spectrum of experience
with a variety of different technologies and the ability to pick up new concepts effortlessly.

I like Astro and Svelte but unfortunately they are the exception. Not everything that shines
is gold and not every new framework proves useful in the long run.

There are a few golden gods that I keep going back to, though: Angular for large-scale, Vue for smaller things
NestJS if I need to touch the backend myself, although this is best avoided - I am **not** a fullstack
developer. I prefer being the best frontend engineer I can be, rather than a jack of all trades,
master of none.

I got the opportunity to pass on some of those hard earned lessons at University of
Applied Sciences Stralsund as a lecturer for the Web Engineering II course.
